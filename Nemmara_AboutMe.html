                    <p class="text-left">Hello, my name is Shravan Nemmara. I 
                    am 15 years old and I am currently in my sophomore year in 
                    Dublin High School. I am currently on track
                    to pursue a career in Civil Engineering and Architecture.
                     I want to design the layouts of homes and buildings because 
                     this field is a great canvas to put my creativity to use.
                     I am very artistic so I believe this career will suit me very well.
                    I plan to major in virtual design and architecture
                    in a good college with an excellent architectural background. 
                     I can use my computer science knowledge to help me 
                    create a virtual design of a building I am designing. Additionally, with my involvment 
                    in the Engineering Academy program this year and years following,
                     I will be able to excell in this career field.
                    <br></br>
                    I believe that I possess the skills to become an architect 
                    because I am good in mathematics and I have the ability to 
                    previously visualize my "creations" so that I can see what 
                    to do. Bascially, I think ahead to the future to be as prepared as possible.
                    I also like working with others, so this cooperation 
                    skill would come in handy when other designers give me input.
                    I was the school Treasurer in eighth grade in my Leadership 
                    class. Currently in the Engineering Academy program, I am
                    able to work with many new people and personalities. This has 
                    made me a very good team player and I am building on my communication skills.
                      With the compiled leadership skills I have obtained, I can 
                    communicate with others easily. I also have good expirience in 
                    documenting monetary values due to my position as Treasurer.
                     My downside is that I tend to get 
                    upset when things don't work the first time. 
                    I am working on this set back persistently so I could better myself.
                    One aspiration of mine is to join the high school 
                    swim team and/or badminton. I would also like to  swim and play badminton 
                     in college as well. I have
                    been swimming for nine years and would like to take it to a 
                    competitive level. Already in my high school career I have accomplished my goal of being
                    accepted into the Engineering Academy. This is one of my greatest 
                    accomplishments and one I am extremely proud of. My next goal is based on college acceptance 
                    and grades mostly.
                    <br></br>
                    In conclusion, I believe that I have the skill to pursue my 
                    future career in the field or architecture. In the present 
                    time I would like to swim and play badminton competitively 
                    in high school and 
                    college. I would also like to continue my "career" or involment in the Engineering Academy.

                    know me. If you would like to get to know me better please
