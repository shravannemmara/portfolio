                    <p class="text-left">Hello, my name is Shravan Nemmara. I 
                    am 14 years old and I am currently in my freshman year in 
                    Dublin High school. I gained an interest in computer 
                    programming after I saw what type of coding and engineering 
                    my father was doing for his job. He cretes softwares for computer switches.
                    I want to pursue a career 
                    in architecture or virtual design. I want to design the 
                    layouts of homes and buildings and maybe touch in on interior 
                    design. I plan to major in computer sciences and architecture
                    in a good college with an excellent architectural background and use my computer science knowledge to 
                    start designing structures virtually. I want to become an architect 
                    because this field of study interests. I get to have 
                    an imaginative aspect to this job because I have to design 
                    layouts. I can use my computer science knowledge to help me 
                    create a virtual design of a building I am designing.
                    <br></br>
                    I believe that I possess the skills to become an architect 
                    because I am good in mathematics and I have the ability to 
                    previously visualize my "creations" so that I can see what 
                    to do. Bascially I think ahead into the future to be a prepared as possible.
                    I also like working with others, so this cooperation 
                    skill would come in handy when other designers give me input.
                    I was the school Treasurer in eighth grade in my Leadership 
                    class. So, with the leadership skills I have obtained, I can 
                    communicate with others easily and the documenting of the 
                    classes income for dances and fundraisers will contribute
                    to my mathematics skills. My downside is that I tend to get 
                    upset when things don't work the first time.
                    One aspiration of mine is to join the high school 
                    swim team and/or badminton and swim and play badminton 
                    competitively in college as well. I have
                    been swimmng for seven years and would like to take it to a 
                    competitive level. This is a big passion of mine. Alredy in my
                    high school career I have accomplished a great task of being
                    accepted into the Engineering Academy. This is one of my greatest 
                    accomplishments and one I am extremely proud of.
                    <br></br>
                    In conclusion, I believe that I have the skill to pursue my 
                    future career in the field or architecture. In the present 
                    time I would like to swim and play badminton competitively 
                    in high school and 
                    college. I would aslo like to continue my "career" or involment in the Engineering Academy.
                    Thank you for taking the time to get to
                    know me. If you would like to get to know me better please 
                    explore the rest of my portfolio and feel free to contact me through my email.
