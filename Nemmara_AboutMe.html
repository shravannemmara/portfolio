                    <p class="text-center">Hello my name is Shravan Nemmara. I am 14 years
                    old and I am currently in my freshmen year in Dublin High school. I gained
                    an interest in computer programming after I saw what type of coding and 
                    engineering he was doing for his job. I want to pursue a career in coding
                    or in architecture. I want to design the layouts of homes and buildings 
                    and maybe touch on interior design. I plan to major in computer sciences
                    and archetecture in a god college and use my computer science knowledge
                    to start designing after getting approved by the ARE. I want to become 
                    an architect because this field of study interests me and I get to have
                    an imaginative aspect to this job because I have to design layouts. I can
                    use my computer science knowledge to help me create a virtual design of
                    a building I am designing.
                    <br></br>
                    I belive that I possess the skills to become an architect because I am 
                    good a mathematics and I have the abbility to previously visualize my 
                    "creations" so that I can see what to do. I also like working with others 
                    so this cooperation skill would come in handy when other designers give 
                    me input. I was th school treasurer in eight grade in my leadership class. 
                    So I belive with my leadership skills I can communicate with others easily 
                    and the documenting of the schools finances contribute to my mathematic 
                    skills. My downside is that I am not very patient with myself and tend
                    to get discouraged when things don't work the first time. Some of my 
                    acheivments in high school comprise of finishing two big computer science
                    projects in my Computer Science Principles class. I had to make a game in 
                    Scratch and MIT App Inventor. I used my coding skills to make the game and 
                    I got a good score on both of them. This achivment I am really proud of.
                    One aspiration of mine is to join the hig school swim team and swim
                    competitively in college as well.
                    <br></br>
                    In conclusion, I belive that I have the skill to pursue my future career
                    of becoming an architect. In present time I would like to be on the swim
                    and swim competitively later on in college possibly. Thank you for taking
                    to get to know me. If you would like to get to know me better please 
                    explore the rest of my portfolio and feel free to contact me.
