                            <h5>September 2018</h5>
                            <p> In my Computer Science Principles class, my 
                            partner, Edmund Feng, and I created a mini-game called 
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/244915237/#player" target="_blank">
                            "Block Parkour"</a> in Scratch. Over a few weeks we 
                            had to create a game or story which had user 
                            interaction and multiple levels. We brainstormed 
                            many ideas and we chose to make a parkour game with
                            the player controlling a block using arrow keys. The
                            player had to get the block through obstacles, mainly
                            jumping from level to level. We also added lava in 
                            some levels which the block could not touch. My 
                            partner and I kept thorough
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5RSA1VlmPaWQ1n8nKe78tBCCbCzrYFXRjbk2WhJW5s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>
                            for referring back to the earlier stages of the 
                            project. We had multiple difficulties such as 
                            programming the lava in some levels, but we worked 
                            together and figured it out. One more difficulty was
                            finding the right gravity for the block for all the 
                            levels, but through much trial and error we found the
                            right gravity number. I learned many new functions 
                            in this project and was able to understand them easily
                            through the help of my peers. All in all, it was a
                            great learning experience for me and I got to make 
                            some new friends as well.</p>

                            <p> In my Computer Science Principles class, my 
                            partner, Siri Phaneendra, and I created a mini-game called 
                            "Night in the Museuem : Text Adventure" in Cloud9 in the 
                            Python language. Over two weeks we 
                            had to create a python game integrated with user 
                            interaction and multiple levels or storylines. We brainstormed 
                            many ideas and we chose to make a game cetered around the movie "Night at the Museum"
                            The player had to decide stpryline and how the story would continue by either choosing,by typing, "A" or "B".
                            My partner and I kept thorough
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I5YzkH5MQslTtBaRMba-vy5MvSXCzOoQpEYUC_zaOg4/edit" target="_blank">documentation</a>
                            and we had multiple flowcharts so that we could acurately follow the movies storyline, 
                            which was slightly modified by my partner and I. 
                            We had multiple levels of the storyline and there was 
                            five ways the storyline of the game could end. 
                            One difficulty was coding the storyline to match the correct variable with the correct storyline.
                            My partner and I were able to efficiently communicate with each other 
                            and we were able to produce a good, solid game.</p>

                            <h2>Mechanical Winch System</h2>
                            <h5>October 2019</h5>
                            <p> In my  class Honors Principles Of Engineering, my 
                            partners, Shaan M., Romyr C., Sai K., and I created a mechanical winch for our 1.2.5 engineering project.
                            The purpose of this project was to test our teamwork skills, creativity, and our understanding of the partners
                            given to us to build the prototype. The background of the project was that a construction company needed us to build
                            a scale prototype of a winch for them to lift heavy objects. My partners and I kept thorough
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dXVmPGKgXIC0NVf-9gaBbU1q8HZpigGCaDfDpKkzYpA/edit" target="_blank">documentation</a>
                            of our project and have fully stated to constraints and the rules of this project. In this project I mainly
                            contributed to the engineering aspect, building the actual winch and creatively thinking what was the most efficiently   
                            ay for this project to complete its given task. With the help of Romyr, he and I built the winch, my specific contribution
                            being the building of the structure of the winch, making it a compact and efficient design. I also did a large part 
                            of the documentation such as the design brief and parts of the modifications table. Some problems we had while building
                            this winch was how to implement the motor to the structure of the winch. Our given parts were not all from the same
                            brand so implementing them both together was a challenge, but through some creativity and teamwork, we were able to 
                            successfully mesh the motor to the other systems of the gears. Overall this project went extremely well and the objective 
                            of the project was fulfilled.</p>

                            <h2>Aerodynamic Design</h2>
                            <h5>January 2020</h5>
                            <p> In my Honors Principles Of Engineering class, my 
                            partners, Kaylen Carter-Chisolm, Sai Kolla, Isha Nayak, 
                            and I created a rocket design as a proposal for toy rockets.
                            We had to create two design's each and then test them for distance, style, and altitude.
                            We then had to pick the best design and modify it one 
                            last time and propose that design to the clients.
                            We kept thorough
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZxCny1T6-w3pYNnvgRA28ZMSIRZ_va_tjwSy5swB7Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" >documentation</a>
                            for all of our designs and our final design. We explained our designs
                            as well. While building the rockets we had limited supplies so it was a challenge building a
                            strong rocket. The supplied we had were paper and tape and thats quite it.
                            During the construction there were many issues we had to face like the 
                            flexibility of the paper and the way we had to layer it. It was difficult to
                            layer the paper but with some teamwork we were able to help each other out with their induvidual 
                            designs. I created the winning design with an altitude of 60 ft and a distance
                            of 90 ft. I was also the launcher for our group as well. My partner's and I were 
                            able to communicate efficiently to produce good designs and we were able complete 
                            our documentation proffesionally to display all of our potential designs.</p>
