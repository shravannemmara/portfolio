                            <h2>Block Parkour</h2>
                            <h4>September 2018</h4>
                            <p> In my Computer Science Principles class, my 
                            partner and I created a mini-game called 
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/244915237/#player">
                            "Block Parkour"</a> in Scratch. Over a few weeks we 
                            had to create a game or story which had user 
                            interaction and multiple levels. We brainstormed 
                            many ideas and we chose to make a parkour game with
                            the player controlling a block using arrow keys. The
                            player had to get the block through obstacles, mainly
                            jumping from level to level. We also added lava in 
                            some levels which the block could not touch. My 
                            partner and I kept thorough
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5RSA1VlmPaWQ1n8nKe78tBCCbCzrYFXRjbk2WhJW5s/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>
                            for referring back to the earlier stages of the 
                            project. We had multiple difficulties such as 
                            programming the lava in some levels, but we worked 
                            together and figured it out. One more difficulty was
                            finding the right gravity for the block for all the 
                            levels, but through much trial and error we found the
                            right gravity number. I learned many new functions 
                            in this project and was able to understand them easily
                            through the help of my peers. All in all, it was a
                            great learning experience for me and I got to make 
                            some new friends as well.</p>

                        <p> In my CSP class my partner and I created a drawing

                        for the game. All we did was add more colors and new 
                        features like pictures and an erase button.</p>
