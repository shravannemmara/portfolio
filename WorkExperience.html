                <p>During my time in the Engineering Academy program, I have met 
                    several industry professionals through workplace 
                    field trips and guest speakers. These guest speakers and trips
                    were given for us to explore different areas of engineering such as chemical
                    engineering and civil engineering. Through this program, I was exposed to 
                    many different fields and they have been very influential in my career 
                    process. 
                    <br></br>
                    One guest speaker that was very noteworthy for me was Ms. Emma Schoenthol, Civil 
                    engineer at 
                    <a href="https://bellecci.com/" target="_blank">Bellecci & Associates Inc.</a> The majority of Ms. Schoenthal's work is 
                    civilian projects such as downtown projects and sidewalk reconstruction. She designs 
                    blueprints and ideas for clients, mainly the city managers. She also writes reports 
                    for completed projects as well. During this presentation she showed us what the 
                    majority of her work is and also showed us plans for a new project that they are 
                    working on. We were able to learn new engineering terms and lingo in the Civil Engineering 
                    field. One phrase that stuck with me was the term "pork chop" island. It is the small island 
                    in an intersection to get to the main stoplight. This presentation was very influential 
                    for me because Civil Engineering is my main career path and that is what I want to be 
                    when I grow up. Though I believe I will do better in Residential Engineering I still
                    think that this presentation was very informative. One key takeaway from this presentation 
                    is that the maximum slope for a sidewalk for ADA accessibility is 7.4%
                    <br></br>
                    Along with guest speakers coming to DHS for the Engineering Academy, the students, including 
                    myself, get to go on many field trips and see facilities that take part in engineering fields.
                    One memorable field trip we recently went on was to 
                    <a href="https://www.roche.com/careers/our-locations/americas/usa/pleasanton_california.htm" target="_blank">Roche Molecular Labs</a> in Pleasonton, California. 
                    In this field trip we were able to see the inner workings of America's leading corporation 
                    in Molecular Diagnostics. We were able to see the labs where they cultured bacteria samples. We were also 
                    given a tour of their mobile sales bus, used to travel the country to exhibit their technology 
                    to potential clients. This field trip was influential for me because it made me really 
                    think about a career in Biotechnology and this field was one of my options before Civil 
                    Engineering as well. Their amazing internship program also tempted me to join because there 
                    are many oppurtunities in this field to grow and grasp knowledge. One part of the field 
                    trip that I especially liked was the mentor question part. We were able to ask questions to 
                    employees there from different backgrounds and see how they worked and what they did for a job. 
                    This part of the trip really stood out to me because I was able to gain so many new perspectives 
                    on my career and that pathway. I learned that a career isn't set-in-stone and that I could change 
                    whenever I wanted and that was something I genuinely needed to hear. One key takeaway from this 
                    trip is that there are many types of jobs in this company such as sales, doctors, and lab work 
                    so there are many options to choose from while still staying in the Engineering field.
